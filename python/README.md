# Python/SQL Projects

**Author:** Varun Kammanni

## Overview

This repository showcases a collection of data analysis and visualization projects, leveraging real-world datasets from sources such as Kaggle and personal projects. The work demonstrates proficiency in Python for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and advanced visualization, with a focus on actionable business insights.

## Project Structure

- **Absenteeism_clean/**  
  Analysis of employee absenteeism data, including data cleaning and feature engineering.
- **Data Visualization/**  
  A suite of Python scripts for generating bar charts, line charts, histograms, pie charts, scatter plots, and stacked area charts using real datasets.
- **Others/**  
  Additional projects, including loan data analysis and currency exchange rate exploration.
- **UK_Bank Customers/**  
  Customer segmentation and regional analysis for a UK bank, with visualizations and Jupyter notebooks.

## Data Sources

- **Kaggle Datasets:**  
  - Employee Absenteeism  
  - Loan Data  
  - Real Estate Prices  
- **Personal Projects:**  
  - UK Bank Customer Data  
  - EUR-USD Exchange Rates

## Key Analyses & Insights

### 1. Employee Absenteeism (Kaggle)
- **Objective:** Identify patterns and drivers of absenteeism in the workplace.
- **Process:**  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing  
  - Feature engineering (e.g., calculating workload averages, BMI categories)
  - Exploratory analysis to uncover trends by age, distance, education, and more
- **Outcome:** Actionable insights for HR to reduce absenteeism and improve productivity.

### 2. Data Visualization Suite
- **Objective:** Demonstrate mastery of Python visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- **Scripts:**  
  - Bar, line, and pie charts for categorical and time-series data  
  - Histograms and scatter plots for distribution and correlation analysis  
  - Stacked area charts for multi-category trends over time
- **Outcome:** Clear, publication-ready charts for business reporting and presentations.

### 3. Loan Data Analysis
- **Objective:** Analyze loan approval patterns and risk factors.
- **Process:**  
  - Data cleaning and transformation  
  - Statistical analysis of loan amounts, interest rates, and approval status
- **Outcome:** Insights for financial institutions to optimize lending strategies.

### 4. UK Bank Customer Segmentation
- **Objective:** Segment customers by region and demographic attributes.
- **Process:**  
  - Data wrangling and aggregation  
  - Visualization of customer distribution and key metrics
- **Outcome:** Recommendations for targeted marketing and customer engagement.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy)
